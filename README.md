# IHD-Prediction-using-Deep-Stacking

**Objective:** Goal is to find presence or absence of heart disease in an individual by building reliable Machine Learning models with higher performance using Python. 

**Modelling:** Varieties of prediction algorithms are applied and some chosen models are used in the creation of far more consistent and accurate model using a deep stacking approach.

**Performance Analysis:**
